    Hi, welcome to my site. I'm a one man team that just started translating Japanese webnovels.
    I'm also building the website myself so it's going to ugly.
    To start off I plan to do teasers of a few webnovels to get some practice translating and also which one I like and want to continue with.
    If there's a novel you want me to continue or do a teaser of you can let me know by joining the discord server in the contact link.
    You can also let me know about all constructive criticism or suggestions you have.

    Here's chapter two since the prologue was really short and nothing much happened in that chapter, although nothing happens in this one either.
    I plan to move on and translate something else next.
