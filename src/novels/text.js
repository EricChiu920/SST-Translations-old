      “............”
      
      I was speechless looking at the scenery in front of me.
      
      The rotting fence.
      The yard full of weeds.
      The wall that seemed as if it would crumble at any moment and the cloudy glass windows.
      The signboard with “Alchemy” written on it that showed it’s owned by the nation was barely hanging from the roof.
      
      This is my destination?
      
      After trying many times I barely managed to get my national alchemist certification.
      Due to my master’s recommendation I acquired a store and left the capital with high expectations on a long trip.
      It took about a month to arrive.
      Despite all that effort ――
      “...this is too much”

      “I suppose it was a bit too good to be true”
      Even if it was in a small village in a remote region, the building only cost 10,000 Rea.
      That amount would be equivalent to the cost of renting a small room in the capital for two months.
      It was only that much.
      The cost was subsidized by the country so the actual price would have been a bit higher but even then it would have been too cheap.

      “Your own store”
      I can’t say I wasn’t lured in by that lovely phrase.
      I can’t say I wasn’t but I really had no plans of coming to a place like this.

      Get employed by a store in the capital and save up money while learning.
      And with those funds I would open a store in a suitable suburban city, even if it was small if the atmosphere would be good. Or that was the plan.
      I didn’t hope to become rich and live in luxury.
      If I earned enough to live and be able to repay the favors I’ve received that would have been enough.
      
      Despite that, why am I in such a remote town ―― no, a small remote village with just a few luggage?
      The reason for that dates back to around one month ago...

      Royal Alchemist School.
      
      That is the only school in this country where you can receive the national certification to become a alchemist.
      As long as you manage to get your alchemist qualifications after graduating from this school you would be set for life.
      You were guaranteed a easy life.
      Because of that the competition to enter the school is fierce and successfully graduating is very difficult.
      Having to pass through difficult hurdles to meet high standards is the defining trait of the royal alchemist school.
      
      After all, alchemist is a elite occupation.
      From being able to make potions to artifacts that are indispensable to daily life, the demand vastly outstrips the supply.
      Since the country controls the price the goods would never fall too much in price.
      Simply put the profit ratio is extremely high, as long as you choose a commodity there is no worry about unsold items.
      Because of that a alchemist won’t ever miss a meal, actually even without working hard you would earn more than enough to live comfortably.
      
      If you put in the effort anyone, a commoner or even a orphan can be accepted into the royal alchemist school.
      The school lends out a textbook where you can learn all the necessary information for the entrance exam.
      On top of that the exam doesn’t cost anything.
      Of course if you’re illiterate it would be impossible but even at a orphanage if you wish to learn to read and write it’s possible to do so, as long as the individual puts in the effort.
      Also if your results on the exam are exceptional you could have your tuition be waived, given a scholarship, or even be given a cash reward. In a way a “as long as you study you’ll be fine” environment was created.
      
      However, because that environment was so blessed the door to enter was very narrow.
      For commoners and orphans this is about the only way up in life so many of them apply, therefore the entrance exam is extremely difficult.
      Furthermore, nobles who learned from excellent private tutors would be taking the same exam so half hearted attempts would not cut it.
      And even if you manage to pass the entrance exam you can’t relax yet.
      If you don’t pass the tests that happen every four months the school will mercilessly expel you.
      Of course, there is no make up examination and even nobles are no exception to this.
      
      As a result less than 10% of people manage to make it to the graduation ceremony 5 years later.
      And today, I, Salasa Feido graduated from that school.
      It was tough times.
      The elation of graduation?
      There was no time for for that.
      The final exam for graduation was just yesterday.
      And this morning the results were announced.
      In the worst case if I failed, there was the nightmare of coming to school but not being able to attend the graduation ceremony.
      I don’t know who thought of this, but this schedule is just cruel.
      
      As expected, the people that have failed the previous exam didn’t attend the ceremony.
      Since students have been continuously weeded out there isn’t anyone left without exceptional grades.
      If you relax there’s always the chance that you will fail for all the exams. But if you imagine the situation where on the day of the graduation ceremony you would be left in the classroom you would study even more than compared to the other exams.
      The only danger would perhaps be getting sick? Of course that is something everyone is aware of so they would take care of their health and body properly. If they were worried they might even take a day off from school to properly rest and recover.
      Of course I also studied with all my effort.
      As a result of my effort, along with my diploma I also received a cash bonus from the final examination.
      A very welcome gift.
      
      I think due to my parents passing away in an accident when I was 8 and I was sent to an orphanage, I single-mindedly studied as if that was my escape from reality to at least avoid 
      a low paying job.
      Because of that I caused some trouble for others at the orphanage but there was a tacit understanding that everyone should support those that aimed for the royal alchemist school so I wasn’t criticized too much.
      In return if you managed to successfully become an alchemist it was expected that you would donate some money back to the orphanage.
      Alchemists that have came from this orphanage donate to us at regular intervals so that we didn’t have to pinch pennies to live.
      Thanks to studying so much, I entered the school with excellent results (especially for a commoner) and had my tuition waived, and also was qualified for a scholarship. After getting qualified for entering the dorm I moved out of the orphanage at the age of 10.
      
      After that I spent all my time studying and working at a part time job.
      Luckily, I was working at a alchemist’s store and was taken as a apprentice by the owner.
      Thanks to being able to learn at my part time job even though it took time away from studying I was able to stay at a level where I scored high enough in the exams to get the cash reward.

      Unfortunately I rarely every managed to get first place but I could take relief in the fact that everyone that scored higher than me were all nobles.
      Why was I relieved? Was it due to the custom of the cash reward? Tradition? It was something along those lines.
      Normally the cash reward are only awarded to those that score in the top three.
      If that was strictly followed maybe I would maybe only have half the total amount now?
      But the nobles that scored in the top places would refuse the reward saying something like “It’s a noble’s duty”.
      And so the cash reward would be given to the person who scored the next highest.
      More than half of the cash reward I received was due to this.
      Of course no one was being forced but to show a noble’s pride they would refuse the reward.
      For those lower nobles they may be even poorer than wealthy commoners so that custom must have been quite troubling for them.
      For me it was a very thankful custom however.
      
      Thanks to that after graduating I managed to save up over 5,000,000 Rea.
      For a average citizen they wouldn’t even earn 500,000 Rea in a year, so I managed to earn over ten times their annual income.
      I can tell myself that I did very well.
      Over half of the amount I saved up was from the cash reward and scholarship, the remaining amount was from the part time job.
      Even though I didn’t have to pay for living or food expenses since I lived in the dorm, managing to save up that much between classes and studying was extremely extremely… difficult.
      My part time job daily wages was around what a person would normally earn for an entire day’s work.
      This was a amount I could only earn because I was a alchemist’s apprentice and worked part time at my master’s store.
      I managed to earn this much working part time for a alchemist which just shows how much a alchemist earns.
      
      And from today on I have become a alchemist.
      Taking out the alchemist license I just received at the graduation ceremony from my pocket I took a good look at it.
      It’s made of a mysterious material where it’s like thin gold but extremely light and flexible.
      Written on it was a alchemist’s mark, my name, and the royal alchemist’s academy’s seal.
      Also my magic power in recorded in it so if someone else besides me touches it the license will appear blank. Due to that you could say the license itself is a masterpiece of a alchemist.
      “Mufufu”. As a smile was about to unintentionally appear on my face I put my hands on my cheeks.
      It would be suspicious to start smiling alone in front of the gate.
      ...alone
      Yes, alone.
      
      
      The graduation ceremony smoothly ended and it’s time to open a new chapter in your life. But I was standing in front of the school game by my lonely self.
      For the past five years I’ve done nothing but work and study.
      Due to that even though I’ve graduated I have no friends to greet me.
      And no friends to go to greet.
      Around me are kouhais that are sad that they have to part with the graduating students and those that are happily conversing with each other but around me the mood was a little different.
      No one came up to me.
      I - I wasn’t sad or anything though.
      Well, to tell the truth I was just a little sad.

      I had almost no friends. I had no one to blame but myself for that so it couldn’t be helped.
      After all if you spend all your time studying and rarely ever conversing with others it’s hard to make any friends.
      Well I had almost zero friends but it wasn’t quite zero?
      Until last year I had two senpais that I got along well with.
      And also a kouhai that they I got to know through my senpais.
      But last year they both graduated and are now working in another town so they aren’t in the capital.
      Even now we exchange letters but we weren’t close enough for them to come all the way back to the capital to attend my graduation ceremony. The first year being a alchemist isn’t easy after all, and there is also the travel expenses.
      Speaking of which, besides daily necessities I only spent money for the exchange letters.
      And as for my kouhai, unluckily they got sick a few days ago and wasn’t able to attend the ceremony.
      They were willing to come but right after the graduation ceremony is another periodic test.
      On the unlikely chance that coming would cause them to fail I strongly told my kouhai “You definitely can’t come, properly rest and get better”.
      It’s not a laughing matter to fail the test since it would massively impact your life.
      
      “Un… let’s hurry and go.”
      It’s a little painful to be standing here alone in this atmosphere. Also it’s definitely not my imagination that I was occasionally getting some looks of suspicion.
      I turned back and looked at the school where I spent five years of my life.
      Various things happened during that time. I spent most of the time studying but I still had some fun times.
      At the very least if you can study you won’t have as many troubles in life so if you look at it that way I think it wasn’t a bad way to spend my years in school.
      But from now on I have to move on alone.
      With determination filling my chest I leave the gate with my back facing the school.
